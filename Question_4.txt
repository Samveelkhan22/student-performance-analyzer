The control flow of the program follows a sequential order of execution. Here's a breakdown of the sequence in which the code is executed:

User Input:
The program starts by prompting the user to enter three test scores using the get_grade() function. These inputs are assigned to the variables first_test, second_test, and third_test.

first_test = get_grade()
second_test = get_grade()
third_test = get_grade()


Function Calls and Output:
The program then calls the all_As() function to check if all test scores are 100. The result is printed to the console.

all_As(first_test, second_test, third_test)

Next, the calc_average() function is called to calculate the average of the three test scores, and the result is stored in the variable average.

average = calc_average(first_test, second_test, third_test)

Output of Average:
The program prints the calculated average to the console.

print("Your test average is", average)

Letter Grade:
Finally, the letter_grade() function is called with the average as an argument, and the corresponding letter grade is printed.

letter_grade(average)
